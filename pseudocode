Given a list of activities
those activities will be distribitued in priorities lists
in a loop, till all the priorities lists are empty:
  create a variable operario and add the activities depending on the best function
  create other variables as operarioN_tiempo = total time of the activities in the list
  if the the prioritie list is empty and there is free time left for the operary repeat the process till the next list of priority.
  if the list is not empty and the operary cannot take more activities, so create antoher operary and repeat the process
